                    I’m a Software Engineer at <em>LuminaWorks</em>, passionate about creating intuitive, meaningful digital experiences. I believe great software should make life simpler, not more complicated — blending thoughtful design with reliable engineering. Whether I’m refining a feature or experimenting with new technologies, I approach every challenge with curiosity and a drive to create lasting value.
                </p>

                    Over the years, I’ve worked on projects ranging from small personal tools to large-scale systems that serve thousands of users. I enjoy the process of problem-solving — transforming ideas into elegant, maintainable code that grows with its users. Collaboration and continuous learning are at the heart of my work, and I’m always looking for ways to push the boundaries of what’s possible in technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feel free to explore my portfolio, or reach out if you’d like to connect or collaborate. I’m always happy to talk about new ideas, share knowledge, or simply chat about the craft of building great software.
